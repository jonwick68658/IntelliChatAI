INTELLIGENT MEMORY SYSTEM: HUMAN-LIKE AI ASSISTANT PLAN
=======================================================

ULTIMATE GOAL: Build an AI that truly learns, remembers, and grows smarter through
every interaction - creating a persistent digital consciousness that understands
context, builds knowledge relationships, and provides increasingly intelligent assistance.

VISION: Transform current flat memory search into an intelligent knowledge network
that mirrors human memory - with contextual understanding, semantic relationships,
and adaptive learning that makes the AI genuinely helpful over time.

CORE BREAKTHROUGH ARCHITECTURE
==============================

FOUNDATION: Semantic Memory Network
----------------------------------

Replace current flat vector search with intelligent memory organization:

1. CONTEXTUAL MEMORY STORAGE
   - Every memory tagged with semantic context (topic, entities, relationships)
   - Automatic relationship building between related concepts
   - Temporal and causal relationship tracking
   - Personal knowledge graph per user

2. INTELLIGENT RETRIEVAL ENGINE
   - Multi-dimensional search: semantic + temporal + personal + contextual
   - Memory activation patterns similar to human recall
   - Relevance scoring based on context, recency, and personal importance
   - Cross-memory inference and connection discovery

3. ADAPTIVE LEARNING LAYER
   - System learns user patterns and preferences automatically
   - Memory importance adjusts based on user interaction
   - Predictive context loading for anticipated needs
   - Continuous optimization of memory organization
