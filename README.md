# NeuroLM - Advanced AI Memory System

A next-generation AI chat application that eliminates the context loss problem plaguing traditional LLM interfaces. Built with intelligent memory management using graph database technology for true conversation continuity.

## Why NeuroLM?

**The Problem**: Traditional AI chatbots suffer from "goldfish memory" - every conversation starts from scratch, forcing users to constantly re-explain context, preferences, and background information.

**The Solution**: NeuroLM creates a persistent, evolving memory network that remembers your conversations, builds relationships between ideas, and grows more intelligent over time.

## Core Features

### ðŸ§  Intelligent Memory System
- **Persistent Context**: Remembers conversations across sessions, weeks, or months
- **Graph-Based Architecture**: Neo4j database maps relationships between memories
- **Biomimetic Consolidation**: Strengthens important memories, weakens unused ones
- **Multi-Hop Discovery**: Finds connections between seemingly unrelated topics

### ðŸ¤– Universal Model Access
- **Hundreds of AI Models**: Choose from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, and more
- **Smart Model Selection**: Search and filter by capabilities, cost, context length
- **Cost Optimization**: Select the right model for each task and budget
- **Provider Independence**: Never locked into a single AI vendor

### ðŸ’¬ Advanced Chat Experience
- **Conversation Continuity**: Pick up where you left off, even weeks later
- **Context-Aware Responses**: AI references previous discussions naturally
- **Session Management**: Organized conversation history with smart grouping
- **Document Integration**: Upload and discuss PDF/DOCX files with persistent memory

### ðŸ”§ Technical Capabilities
- **Vector Embeddings**: Semantic similarity matching for intelligent retrieval
- **Association Networks**: Dynamic relationship discovery between concepts
- **Temporal Intelligence**: Memory strength evolves based on usage patterns
- **Background Optimization**: Automatic memory network enhancement
