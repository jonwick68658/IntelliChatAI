## How to Implement This Simple Fix

1. Add this method to your `NeuralMemorySystem` class
2. Call it once when the application starts (before any similarity operations)

## What This Fix Does

1. **Standardizes Embedding Format**: 
   - Converts embeddings to proper numpy format
   - Ensures all embeddings are lists of floats

2. **Checks Dimensions**:
   - Verifies all embeddings have 1536 dimensions
   - Resets to a default zero vector if dimensions are incorrect

3. **Ensures Consistency**:
   - Makes all embeddings the same format regardless of origin
   - Prevents type mismatches between different embeddings

This fix is minimal and targeted at the most common cause of vector similarity errors: inconsistent embedding formats. It doesn't require changes to your core algorithms or queries.
