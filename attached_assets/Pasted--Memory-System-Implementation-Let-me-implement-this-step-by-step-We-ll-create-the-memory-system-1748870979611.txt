This is the first part of the memory system. It includes:

1. **MemoryNode**: Represents individual pieces of information with confidence scoring
2. **MemoryConnection**: Manages relationships between memory nodes
3. **MemorySystem**: The core system that interacts with the database and handles memory operations

To use this system, you would need to have Neo4j installed and accessible. The code reads API keys and credentials from the `.env` file as requested.

Key features included:
- Rule-based categorization of memories
- Confidence scoring and decay mechanisms
- Basic vector-based similarity search
- Contextual filtering framework
- Memory reinforcement system

Would you like me to proceed with the next part of the implementation?
