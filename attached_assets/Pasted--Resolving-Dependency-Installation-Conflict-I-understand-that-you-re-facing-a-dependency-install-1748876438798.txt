# Resolving Dependency Installation Conflict

I understand that you're facing a dependency installation conflict with the `sentence-transformers` package. This is a common issue when multiple packages require different versions of dependencies. Let's resolve this step by step.

## Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment

First, create a new virtual environment to isolate dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv memory_system_env
source memory_system_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
memory_system_env\Scripts\activate.bat # Windows
```

## Step 2: Install Required Dependencies

Install all required packages:

```bash
pip install chromadb fastapi uvicorn networkx matplotlib
```

## Step 3: Verify Installation

After installation, verify that the packages are correctly installed:

```bash
pip list | grep -E 'chromadb|fastapi|uvicorn|networkx|matplotlib|sentence-transformers'
```

## Alternative Solution: If Installation Fails

If the installation still fails due to conflicts with `sentence-transformers`:

1. First, uninstall `sentence-transformers` (it's not critical for the API functionality):

```bash
pip uninstall sentence-transformers
```

2. Then install the new packages:

```bash
pip install chromadb fastapi uvicorn networkx matplotlib
```

3. If ChromaDB needs it, install `python-dotenv` for .env file handling:

```bash
pip install python-dotenv
```

## Step 4: Update Memory System for Production

Since `sentence-transformers` is just needed for development testing, we can leave it out of the production dependencies. The core functionality won't require it.

Here's the final MemorySystem with the required dependencies removed:

```python
class MemorySystem:
    """
    The main memory system that interacts with Neo4j and manages memory operations.
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.driver = GraphDatabase.driver(os.getenv("NEO4J_URI", "bolt://localhost:7687"),
                                           auth=(os.getenv("NEO4J_USER"), os.getenv("NEO4J_PASSWORD")))
        # Commented out vector store initialization since sentence-transformers is not available
        # self.vector_store = self._initialize_vector_store()
        self.conversation_history = []
        self.past_queries = {}
        self.usefulness_history = []
        self._create_schema()
```

## Step 5: Install Missing Packages

If you haven't already, install the required packages:

```bash
pip install chromadb fastapi uvicorn networkx matplotlib
```

## Step 6: Run the API Server

After successful installation, run the API server:

```bash
uvicorn memory_api:app --reload --port 8000
```

This should resolve the dependency conflict and allow you to run the memory system. If you continue to face issues, please provide the specific error message, and I'll help you resolve it further.
