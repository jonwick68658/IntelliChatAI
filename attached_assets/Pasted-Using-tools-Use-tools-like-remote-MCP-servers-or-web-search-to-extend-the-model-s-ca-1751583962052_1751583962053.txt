Using tools
===========

Use tools like remote MCP servers or web search to extend the model's capabilities.

When generating model responses, you can extend model capabilities using built-in **tools**. These tools help models access additional context and information from the web or your files. The example below uses the [web search tool](/docs/guides/tools-web-search) to use the latest information from the web to generate a model response.

Include web search results for the completion

```javascript
import OpenAI from "openai";
const client = new OpenAI();

const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-4o-search-preview",
    web_search_options: {},
    messages: [{
        "role": "user",
        "content": "What was a positive news story from today?"
    }],
});

console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
```

```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o-search-preview",
    web_search_options={},
    messages=[
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What was a positive news story from today?",
        }
    ],
)

print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

```bash
curl -X POST "https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY" \
    -H "Content-type: application/json" \
    -d '{
        "model": "gpt-4o-search-preview",
        "web_search_options": {},
        "messages": [{
            "role": "user",
            "content": "What was a positive news story from today?"
        }]
    }'
```

Available tools
---------------

Here's an overview of the tools available in the OpenAI platformâ€”select one of them for further guidance on usage. Note that currently the file search and computer use tools are only available using the new [Responses API](/docs/api-reference/responses).

[

Function calling

Call custom code to give the model access to additional data and capabilities.

](/docs/guides/function-calling)[

Web search

Include data from the Internet in model response generation.

](/docs/guides/tools-web-search)

Usage in the API
----------------

When making a request to generate a [chat completion](/docs/api-reference/chat/create), you can enable web search by using the `web_search` parameter. This allows the model to access current Internet information during response generation. For additional details, refer to the [web search guide](/docs/guides/tools-web-search).

### Function calling

In addition to built-in tools, you can define custom functions using the `tools` array. These custom functions allow the model to call your application's code, enabling access to specific data or capabilities not directly available within the model.

Learn more in the [function calling guide](/docs/guides/function-calling).
