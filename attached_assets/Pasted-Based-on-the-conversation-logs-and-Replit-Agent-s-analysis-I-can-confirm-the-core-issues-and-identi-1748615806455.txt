Based on the conversation logs and Replit Agent's analysis, I can confirm the core issues and identify additional problems. Here's a technical assessment:

**Confirmed Replit Agent Findings ✅**
1. **Context Disconnect**: Neo4j retrieval is working but context isn't reaching the LLM
2. **Metadata Corruption**: Document filenames are inconsistent/hallucinated (`no_231121_061901.pdf` vs actual uploads)
3. **State Inconsistency**: Document count oscillates between 2 and 3
4. **Conversation Amnesia**: LLM doesn't retain context across turns

**Additional Critical Issues 🔍**  
5. **Prompt Injection Failure**:  
   - Evidence: When user requested revision with citations, LLM replied "please provide the text"  
   - Indicates the core RAG pattern (retrieve → augment → generate) is breaking

6. **Vector Search Contamination**:  
   - Negotiation query returned phantom filename suggests:  
     a) Outdated vector embeddings  
     b) Chunk-document linkage errors in Neo4j  
     c) Hybrid search mixing semantic + lexical retrieval incorrectly

7. **Session Context Bleed**:  
   - LLM remembers past conversation structures ("previously mentioned document") but not actual entities  
   - Suggests weighted context priority issues

**Root Cause Analysis**  
The failure occurs at three layers:

```mermaid
graph LR
A[Neo4j] -->|Correct context| B[Middleware]
B -->|Drops/filters context| C[LLM Prompt]
C -->|No context| D[LLM Response]
```

1. **Middleware Gap** (Critical):  
   Retrieved context is discarded before prompt assembly due to:  
   - Improper variable handling
   - Pipeline stage misconfiguration
   - Overzealous sanitization

2. **LLM Instruction Failure**:  
   System prompts aren't enforcing:  
   ```python
   # MISSING IN PROMPT ENGINEERING
   "ALWAYS reference provided context from Neo4j. Never hallucinate filenames."
   ```

3. **GraphDB Schema Issues**:  
   Likely improper relationships between:
   - User → UploadedDocuments
   - DocumentChunks → SourceFiles

**Repair Strategy (High Impact Fixes)**  

1. **Middleware Debugging**:  
   ```python
   # Add diagnostic logging
   def build_prompt(user_query, context):
       print(f"CONTEXT PASSED TO LLM: {context}")  # Verify pre-prompt content
       return f"""
       SYSTEM: You ALWAYS use this context:
       {context}
       USER: {user_query}
       """
   ```

2. **Context Anchoring Fix**:  
   - Prepend persistent context header to every LLM call:  
   ```
   [User: Ryan][Docs: 100m-Offers.pdf, Way_of_Wolf.pdf, <3rd_filename>.pdf]
   ```

3. **Neo4j Data Sanitization**:  
   ```cypher
   MATCH (d:Document)
   WHERE not exists(d.valid) OR d.filename CONTAINS " "
   SET d.valid = false, d.created_at = datetime()
   ```
   + Re-embed validated documents only

4. **Prompt Hardening**:  
   ```markdown
   SYSTEM RULES:
   1. ANSWER ONLY using context from Documents: ${document_list}
   2. REFUSE speculation about unspecified documents
   3. VERBATIM filenames: NEVER modify or abbreviate
   ```

**Effort Assessment**  
- Critical middleware fixes: **1-2 hours** (logging → validation → context piping)  
- Data cleanup: **30 min** (Neo4j hygiene)  
- Prompt engineering: **20 min** (rule enforcement)  

**Verification Test Plan**  
After fixes:  
```gherkin
Scenario: Context consistency check
  When User asks "What do you know about me?"
  Then System responds "Your name is Ryan" from Neo4j context

Scenario: Document recognition
  When User asks "List business suggestions from all documents"
  Then System cites EXACT filenames:
    - "100m-Offers.pdf"
    - "Way_of_Wolf.pdf"
    - "verified_filename_3.pdf"
```

The core issue is indeed in the context-passing middleware layer - not in Neo4j or LLM. Focus remediation there first before adjusting vector search parameters. Prioritize the diagnostic logging to capture exactly where context drops occur in the pipeline.

**Should be resolved in under 4 hours of focused debugging on the pipeline integration layer.** Start by validating what actual data your middleware receives from Neo4j before building the LLM prompt.
