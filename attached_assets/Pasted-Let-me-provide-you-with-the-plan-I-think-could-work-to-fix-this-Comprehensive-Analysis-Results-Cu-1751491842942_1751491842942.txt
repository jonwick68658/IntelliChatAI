Let me provide you with the plan I think could work to fix this:
Comprehensive Analysis Results
Current System Architecture Issues
1. Hybrid Authentication System (Root Cause)
The system currently uses TWO different authentication mechanisms:

Cookie-based with in-memory dictionary (17 endpoints):

session_id = request.cookies.get("session_id")
if not session_id or session_id not in user_sessions:
Starlette SessionMiddleware (2 endpoints):

user_id = request.session.get('user_id')
if not user_id:
2. SessionMiddleware Present But Unused
FastAPI has SessionMiddleware configured with SECRET_KEY
Only 2 endpoints (/api/topics/{topic_name} deletion endpoints) use request.session
The login endpoint creates sessions in user_sessions dictionary but never populates request.session
This creates a disconnect where middleware exists but isn't integrated
3. Authentication Inconsistencies
19 total endpoints require authentication
17 endpoints use manual cookie validation with user_sessions
2 endpoints use request.session (which is never populated)
Different error patterns: Some return 401, others cause 500 errors
Why The System Was Built This Way
Based on my analysis, this appears to be evolutionary technical debt:

Initial Implementation: Started with simple cookie-based sessions
Middleware Added: SessionMiddleware was added later (probably for intended upgrade)
Partial Migration: Only 2 endpoints were converted to use request.session
Incomplete Integration: Login never populates request.session, creating broken state
Proper Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Fix The Disconnect (Foundation)
Goal: Make the existing SessionMiddleware work properly

Update Login Endpoint:

# In login endpoint, ALSO populate request.session
request.session['user_id'] = user_id
request.session['username'] = username
Fix The 2 Broken Endpoints:

Update deletion endpoints to work with current system or fix session population
Phase 2: Standardize on SessionMiddleware
Goal: Convert all endpoints to use request.session instead of manual cookies

Convert All 17 Endpoints:

# Change from:
session_id = request.cookies.get("session_id")
if not session_id or session_id not in user_sessions:
# To:
user_id = request.session.get('user_id')
if not user_id:
Remove Manual Session Management:

Delete user_sessions = {} global variable
Remove all cookie handling code
Phase 3: Add Database Persistence
Goal: Make sessions persist across server restarts

Configure SessionMiddleware for Database:

# Replace in-memory sessions with database backend
app.add_middleware(SessionMiddleware, 
                  secret_key=SECRET_KEY,
                  session_cookie="session_id",
                  max_age=3600)  # 1 hour expiration
Custom Session Backend (if needed):

Implement database session storage backend
Replace default cookie-only storage
Benefits of This Approach
Uses Existing Infrastructure: Leverages already-configured SessionMiddleware
Industry Standard: SessionMiddleware is the FastAPI/Starlette standard approach
Minimal Code Changes: Endpoints change 3 lines â†’ 2 lines
Automatic Management: Middleware handles cookies, expiration, security
Database Ready: Easy to add persistence to SessionMiddleware
Why This Is The Proper Way
Fixes Root Cause: Resolves the hybrid authentication system
No Workarounds: Uses FastAPI's intended session mechanism
Future-Proof: Easy to enhance with Redis, database backends, etc.
Security: Middleware provides built-in security features
Maintainable: Single point of session control
This approach addresses the core architectural problem that caused the previous implementation attempt to be complex and error-prone.
