Implementation Plan: File Creation and Download Enhancement
Overview
Add file creation capabilities for AI models and implement /download <filename> slash command while preserving all existing functionality.

Phase 1: Download Endpoint Implementation
1.1 Create File Download Route

@app.get("/api/download/{filename}")
async def download_file(filename: str, request: Request):
    # Authenticate user via session
    # Query user_files table for file ownership verification
    # Return file content with proper download headers
1.2 Response Configuration

Set Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="<filename>"
Detect MIME type based on file extension
Stream file content directly from database
Include proper error handling for non-existent files
Phase 2: Slash Command Extension
2.1 Add Download Command to Parser

Extend existing handle_slash_command() function
Add /download <filename> case to command switch
Validate filename parameter
Generate download URL response
2.2 Command Response Format

Check file existence and ownership
Return download link or direct file serving instruction
Provide error messages for invalid filenames
Phase 3: AI File Creation Integration
3.1 File Creation Helper Function

def create_user_file(user_id: str, filename: str, content: str, file_type: str = "text/plain"):
    # Insert into user_files table
    # Return success/failure status
3.2 AI Content Processing

Detect when AI generates file-worthy content (code, documents, data)
Automatically offer file creation option
Generate suggested filenames based on content type
Phase 4: Enhanced File Management
4.1 File Type Detection

Automatic MIME type detection from content
Support for common formats: .txt, .py, .js, .html, .css, .json, .md
Proper file extension handling
4.2 Command Help Update

Add /download to existing help system
Update /files command to show download instructions
Implementation Requirements
Database Changes: None required (existing user_files table sufficient)

New Endpoints:

GET /api/download/{filename} - File download endpoint
Modified Functions:

handle_slash_command() - Add download case
Chat response processing - Add file creation capability
Dependencies: None (uses existing FastAPI, PostgreSQL infrastructure)

Security Considerations
User Isolation: Maintained through existing session authentication
File Access Control: User can only download their own files
Input Validation: Filename sanitization and existence verification
Path Traversal Prevention: Database-based file serving (no filesystem access)

Integration Points
Existing Slash Commands: Seamlessly extends current /files, /view, /delete workflow
File Upload System: Complements existing upload functionality
User Authentication: Leverages current session management
PostgreSQL Storage: Uses established user_files table schema

Testing Strategy
Command Testing: Verify /download works with existing file management commands
Authentication Testing: Ensure users cannot access other users' files
File Type Testing: Validate proper MIME type detection and download headers
Error Handling: Test non-existent files and invalid filenames

Rollback Plan
If issues arise, the enhancement can be disabled by:

Removing download endpoint
Removing /download case from command parser
System returns to current state with zero impact
Estimated Implementation Time
Phase 1: 30 minutes (download endpoint)
Phase 2: 15 minutes (slash command)
Phase 3: 45 minutes (AI integration)
Phase 4: 30 minutes (enhancements)
Total: ~2 hours for complete implementation

This plan maintains complete compatibility with existing functionality while adding the requested enhancement. The implementation leverages current infrastructure without requiring architectural changes.
